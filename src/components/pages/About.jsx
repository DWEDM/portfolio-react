                My skills focus on hardware maintenance, PC repair, and troubleshooting. 
                I enjoy diagnosing issues and bringing systems back to life — it’s both challenging 
                and rewarding to restore something to full working order.

                "To me, learning is a privilege. It gives us the opportunity to grow, to adapt, 
                and to overcome the challenges that shapes our very being."

              <p className="mb-5 font-paragraph fade-up-scroll">
                I also have a creative side — I do art and design, mainly digital illustration. On top of that, 
                I code too, focusing on front-end web development, which is why I built this portfolio.

                  <p className="mb-5 font-paragraph fade-up-scroll">
                    Outside of coding, I dive into creative and community activities. I love doing digital art, mostly character 
                    illustrations — sometimes just for fun, sometimes to study art theory. Music is also a big part of me: I play a 
                    bit of guitar and bass, but the drums are my main thing. I’m part of our church’s PAW team, where I get to serve 
                    as a drummer.

                    I like playing video games too — mostly League of Legends, but I’ve also grown to enjoy indie games 
                    like Stardew Valley and Blasphemous. What I love most are games that challenge me with their mechanics 
                    while also pulling me in with great stories and lore.
