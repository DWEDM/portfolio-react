            I consider myself Technical, methodical, and adaptable. Especially when working with technical problems 
            or unfamiliar tools. I am also the type of person who learns best by doing, and I take the time 
            to understand how things work instead of rushing through tasks. I may not know everything right away, 
            but Iâ€™m committed to learning and improving through hands-on experience and steady effort.
