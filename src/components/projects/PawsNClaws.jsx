               During my college thesis project, I've worked with a website called "Paws'N Claws" 
               along with my four colleagues. My role mostly revolved on front-end design, development and UI functionality, 
               and a little bit of researching here and there...

              <figure className="px-5 flex flex-col gap-2">
                <img src={img1} alt="image 1" className="rounded-xl shadow-xl w-full max-h-[250px] transition-all hover:max-h-[1000px] object-cover" />
                <img src={img2} alt="image 2" className="rounded-xl shadow-xl w-full max-h-[250px] transition-all hover:max-h-[1000px] object-cover" />

              <div className="text-xs mb-8 mt-1 items-center text-center text-accent">
                <p>Some screenshots of the site's HomePage</p>

            <p className="mb-5 font-paragraph">
               This project helped me apply everything I understand on how websites are made, it also helped me 
               apply real world scenario like: how to work as a team, solve technical issues, and meet deadlines I am required to.
               <br/>
               <br/>
               Although the site is no longer hosted, it was a major learning experience that increased my understanding in 
               web development and team collaboration.
